## Overview

The primary aim of this project is the prevention of wildfire spread via a remotely operated excavator.

This repository focuses on the control server mounted on the excavator, powered by a Jetson board. It handles streaming real-time optical (GMSL) and thermal imagery through WebRTC.

The streamed footage is vital for remote operators to effectively control the excavator and suppress fires. 

The system plays an essential role, especially in situations where direct human intervention is dangerous, by enabling remote operation to construct defensive lines against wildfires, thus preventing their spread.
